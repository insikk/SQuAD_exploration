      "0: Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, put Tesla firmly on the \"AC\" side of the so-called \"War of Currents,\" an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888. \n",
      "1: This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. \n",
      "2: The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. \n",
      "3: The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.\n",

      "3: A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. \n",
      "4: Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. \n",
      "5: Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. \n",
      "6: Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[\n",

      "0: Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. \n",
      "1: This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. \n",
      "2: Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. \n",
      "3: This typically results in younger units being placed below older units. \n",
      "4: Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. \n",
      "5: Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. \n",

      "2: This is called antigenic variation. \n",

      "5: The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. \n",
      "6: Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. \n",

      "0: The variant forms of the name of the Rhine in modern languages are all derived from the Gaulish name Rēnos, which was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Greek Ῥῆνος (Rhēnos), Latin Rhenus.[\n",
      "1: [note 3] The spelling with Rh- in English Rhine as well as in German Rhein and French Rhin is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the vocalisation -i- is due to the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as *Rīnaz, via Old Frankish giving Old English Rín, Old High German Rīn, Dutch Rijn (formerly also spelled Rhijn)). \n",
      "2: The diphthong in modern German Rhein (also adopted in Romansh Rein, Rain) is a Central German development of the early modern period, the Alemannic name Rī(n) retaining the older vocalism,[note 4] as does Ripuarian Rhing, while Palatine has diphthongized Rhei, Rhoi. \n",

      "0: In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. \n",
      "1: The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. \n",
      "2: It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. \n",
      "3: For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. \n",
      "4: Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. \n",
      "5: Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. \n",
      "6: In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. \n",
      "7: This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. \n",
      "8: Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". \n",
      "9: Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. \n",
      "10: As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. \n",
      "11: Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power.\n",

      "3: While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. \n",
      "4: Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. \n",
      "5: Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. \n",

      "0: Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. \n",
      "1: Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". \n",
      "2: This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). \n",
      "3: For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. \n",
      "4: If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. \n",
      "5: For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. \n",
      "6: The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. \n",
      "7: In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. \n",

      "0: Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. \n",
      "1: Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. \n",
      "2: Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. \n",
      "3: This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. \n",
      "4: Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. \n",
      "5: For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. \n",
      "6: Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. \n",
      "7: However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. \n",
      "8: Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. \n",

      "0: The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas. \n",
      "1: For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. \n",
      "2: Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. \n",
